If you access the system within these 72 hours, the session will renew for another 72 hours. Starting from version <code>v1.4.0</code>, the default duration has been changed to 168 hours (7 days). The renewal mechanism is still in place, and you can also configure the expiration duration yourself in the <a href="./../advanced/config.html">configuration file</a>. Open the configuration file and find <code>token_expires=168</code> under the <code>base</code> section. Change <code>168</code> to the number of hours you want to set. Save the file and restart the project for the changes to take effect.</p><h2 id="is-import-and-export-a-backup-feature" tabindex="-1">Is Import and Export a Backup Feature? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-import-and-export-a-backup-feature" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Is Import and Export a Backup Feature?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Import and export are not backup features. They can only export the basic configuration of the icon cards in JSON format, not the image files. Currently, the project does not have a built-in backup feature, but it will be considered in the future.</p><h2 id="data-loss-after-docker-version-upgrade" tabindex="-1">Data Loss After Docker Version Upgrade <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-loss-after-docker-version-upgrade" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Data Loss After Docker Version Upgrade&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li>In version v1.4.0, the Docker mounting directory was streamlined.

If the container has been upgraded, the old container ID bound to the card will no longer be available. In versions <code>v1.5.2</code> and above (for security reasons, login is required), it will attempt to automatically rebind. If it does not rebind automatically, you can manually edit the card and reselect the container.</p><h2 id="docker_run_error" tabindex="-1">Reasons that may cause the docker function to not work properly <a class="header-anchor" href="#docker_run_error" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reasons that may cause the docker function to not work properly {#docker_run_error}&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li>In the container running environment, please confirm whether <code>docker.sock</code> has been mounted.

We can set the Sun-Panel environment on computers commonly used outside of the home as the extranet environment. This way, there&#39;s no need to switch frequently, and there&#39;s no confusion.</p><p>Based on the above understanding and considering that in the intranet environment, we may also need to access extranet addresses and vice versa, there is no distinction between intranet and extranet environments for displaying icons.</p><h2 id="custom-footer-cannot-execute-javascript-script-tag-code" tabindex="-1">Custom Footer Cannot Execute JavaScript (script tag) Code <a class="header-anchor" href="#custom-footer-cannot-execute-javascript-script-tag-code" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Custom Footer Cannot Execute JavaScript (script tag) Code&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Due to framework security restrictions, this feature is not supported for now.

You can install an extension from the browser&#39;s extension market, such as <code>custom New Tab</code> or a similar one, and then set your navigation page address as the default homepage within the extension. Additionally, you can install the project address as an application in the browser, allowing you to place the website icon on the start bar and desktop for quick access.</p>',24),s=[r];function i(c,h,d,l,u,p){return o(),t("div",null,s)}const g=e(n,[["render",i]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
