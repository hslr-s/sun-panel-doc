They can only export the configuration files of the icon cards, not the icon files themselves. Currently, the project does not have a built-in backup feature, but it will be considered in the future.</p><h2 id="data-loss-after-docker-version-upgrade" tabindex="-1">Data Loss After Docker Version Upgrade <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-loss-after-docker-version-upgrade" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Data Loss After Docker Version Upgrade&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li>In version v1.4.0, the Docker mounting directory was streamlined.

We can set the Sun-Panel environment on computers commonly used outside of the home as the extranet environment. This way, there&#39;s no need to switch frequently, and there&#39;s no confusion.</p><p>Based on the above understanding and considering that in the intranet environment, we may also need to access extranet addresses and vice versa, there is no distinction between intranet and extranet environments for displaying icons.</p><h2 id="custom-footer-cannot-execute-javascript-script-tag-code" tabindex="-1">Custom Footer Cannot Execute JavaScript (script tag) Code <a class="header-anchor" href="#custom-footer-cannot-execute-javascript-script-tag-code" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Custom Footer Cannot Execute JavaScript (script tag) Code&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Due to framework security restrictions, this feature is not supported for now.
