If you access the system within these 72 hours, the session will renew for another 72 hours. Starting from version <code>v1.4.0</code>, the default duration has been changed to 168 hours (7 days). The renewal mechanism is still in place, and you can also configure the expiration duration yourself in the <a href="./../advanced/config.html">configuration file</a>. Open the configuration file and find <code>token_expires=168</code> under the <code>base</code> section. Change <code>168</code> to the number of hours you want to set. Save the file and restart the project for the changes to take effect.</p><h2 id="is-import-and-export-a-backup-feature" tabindex="-1">Is Import and Export a Backup Feature? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-import-and-export-a-backup-feature" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Is Import and Export a Backup Feature?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Import and export are not backup features.
