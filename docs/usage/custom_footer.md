# Custom footer

::: tip 
Added in v1.3.0, we can customize the footer code through `App Launchers` -> `Basic Settings` -> `Custom Footer`. This feature requires basic HTML coding skills. **If you don't understand, do not fill in code from unknown sources**. If the page becomes distorted after entering code, you can click the clear button next to the input box or `Reset`. If you have great ideas and a spirit of contribution, you can click `Edit this page on GitHub` at the bottom of the page to add your ideas.
