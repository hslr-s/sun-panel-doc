# Beautification Instructions Beta

 Requiring [custom CSS and JS](./custom_js_css.md) and [custom footer](../usage/custom_footer.md) for enhanced styles and flexible functionality, providing more playability. Group folding and custom project card sizes for each group are available. Everything awaits our exploration together. Using this feature requires extensive front-end knowledge (JS, CSS, HTML).

## Group Style Classes

Supported starting from `v1.5.*`, a unique identifier for groups has been added. This identifier is included in the HTML tag class. Since this is a `beta` feature, it may be adjusted or removed at any time in the future. Please refer to the latest version instructions and documentation.

::: info Note
The class name format for groups is: `item-group-[unique group identifier]`
:::

Example:

If your unique group identifier is `test`, the class name should be: `item-group-test`.

> [!TIP]
> If your project is used by multiple people, to avoid style conflicts, you can add your own prefix to the unique group identifier.

## Card style classes

Supported starting from `v1.6.0`
Project card adds a unique "class" attribute. The naming rule is `item-card-name-xx` (`xx` is the unique identifier in the project card settings)


## Other instructions
Since the author is quite busy and does not have time to actually implement the function, there is no relevant tutorial effect. If I have time to do it later or if there are friends who are willing to share it, I will post it here.
